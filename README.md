# swing-analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes data from Wit motion IMU [WT901BLECL MPU9250 ](https://witmotion-sensor.com/products/bluetooth-5-0-accelerometer-inclinometer-wt901blecl-mpu9250-high-precision-9-axis-gyroscope-anglexy-0-05-accuracy-magnetometer-with-kalman-filter-low-power-3-axis-ahrs-imu-sensor-for-arduino?srsltid=AfmBOor1Eh4oUUIrsza8Au3AIIvQzP4t4xRMAehkMxwhPaNFFWEWgUbk)

## Data collection

We use the Wit motion app and record data via text file.  Example data files are stored in `data` folder.

## Analysis 

Notebooks and scripts are stored in the top level of this repository 

`data-vis-nhan.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that preprocesses the text file data from the IMU and makes some basic plots.
